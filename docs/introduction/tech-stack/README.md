## üß© **Tech Stack (Future Web App Vision)**

This vault is powered by several modern tools and practices for collaboration, code sharing, and documentation. Feel free to explore more about our tech stack:

If this turns into a community-driven web interface:

```bash
‚Ä¢ Frontend: React / Svelte / Next.js / Vue
‚Ä¢ Backend: Go
‚Ä¢ Storage: GitHub + SQLite/Postgres
‚Ä¢ Auth: GitHub OAuth (optional)
‚Ä¢ Deployment: AWS
```

UI/UX ideas for the future web App

```bash
Most preferable one for now:
1. Modern Library-Style UI
   - Homepage: A clean, minimalist grid of featured archives with a search bar in the center.
   - Filters & Categories: Sidebar with quick access to categories (by year, author, tags, etc.).
   - Reading Mode: Dark/light mode toggle, distraction-free fullscreen mode.
   - Bookmarking & Notes: Users can highlight text and add personal notes to archives.
```

Other types of UI

```bash
2. Timeline-Based UI
3. Grid & Gallery UI
4. Terminal-Inspired UI
5. Tag-Based UI
6. Map-Based UI
7. AI-Assisted UI
8. Infinite Scroll vs. Pagination Debate
```
