# RBAC

This is where all the RBAC stuff goes

```go
package rbac
```
Already did a mock RBAC implementation for superadmin in `superadmin.go`

If you wanna create a role and logic for that feel free to do so in this folder. 

Every role should be in its own file. such as `admin.go`, `moderator.go`, `user.go`, etc.
